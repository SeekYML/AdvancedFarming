Improves Minecraft's boring farming system by adding a variety of new Features!

This plugin aims to make farming more interesting and actually have an actual use. 

In my opinion it seems so boring and useless. That's why i'm reworking it!


Current Features:
- Replenish Enchantment
- Config System


TODO:
- Add "Anti-Crop-Break" Boots with the ability to move quicker on farmland.
- Add XP Rewards for Farming
- Make Mobs trample unprotected Farms
- Farming Leaderboards
- Balance Farming to shift it a bit more into mid-game
- Add "Harversting" Enchantment (More Crops)
- And probably more!


If you have any ideas, please let me know via Github or here on SpigotMC.
